        <p>
            Hey all! <br />My name is Deondre and I am a rising photographer eager to shoot with you. I started 
            photography when my love of sunsets and other beautiful views drove me to finally purchase a camera, and when
            I took my first picture I immediately fell in love with photography. Though I love taking photos of nature and viewpoints,
            I have also gained significant experience shooting graduation and portraiture photos, so much so that I realized I
            enjoy taking photos of people as well! The mix of meeting new people, visiting new locations, and taking breathtaking photos
            makes me very passionate about my work, so if you're looking for a photographer to capture your memories, I'm your guy : )
