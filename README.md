# Description
This project utilized React, HTML, and CSS to build a photography portfolio website displaying photos I took myself. The goal was to learn React and leverage its state management capabilities, among other things, to deploy a smooth and visually appealing commercial website. It goes without saying that these photos are copyrighted and should not be used without my permission.

# Features
- Draggable before & after image edits slider
- Intersection observers for lazy loading and scroll-based visual effects
- Typewriter text visuals
- Image carousels

# What I Learned
This was my first major project, and an important lesson I learned was the necessity of maintaining perspective. Perspective on the end goal, and perspective on the challenges and bugs I faced throughout coding this. As a result, I've developed a habit for taking 'insurmountable' tasks and breaking them down into smaller, more feasible components in a way that drives progress even when I run into roadblocks. Ultimately, the most important lesson I learned was more of an epiphany: Programming is a lot of tear-out-your-hair problem-solving and frustrating debugging -- and I love every aspect of it.

# What's Next
Given that this only contains frontend code, the next step would be to learn and implement the rest of the MERN tech stack to develop my own CMS for uploading and organizing photos.
